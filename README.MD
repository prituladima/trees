Java Community Dnepr
========

This is the project where you can train you algorithmic skills in:

- Pre-requirements and terms (example with minimum in arrays) 
    - Invariant 
    - Relaxation of answer
    - Optimal answer constructive
    - Dynamic programming 
    - Correctness
    - Marker that solution is not exists
    - Tail recursion over iteration 

- Build your own graph using Java SDK
    - From edge list to adjacency lists; 


Array of integers in ascending order:
* How to find any value
* How to find lower bound
* How to find upper bound
* How to calculate value in range

todo 
create tests for binary search (int, dates)
create pictures for binary search
create slides in presentation with arrays and solution tree
creates slides with usage




todo
migrate project to maven wrapper





Pictures was build with [this tool](https://graphonline.ru/)
